<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  Greetings! My name is Roane, 
  and I am an ambitious and self-driven individual with a passion for technology, investment, and strategic business planning. 
  At 18 years old, I have already cultivated a diverse skill set and substantial experience in various domains.
</p>

<p>
  From a young age, I realized the importance of self-reliance and financial independence. This realization motivated me to start learning coding at the age of 15. 
  I have since developed proficiency in front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
  as well as back-end development using MySQL Database and Python. 
  Coding has not only been my primary professional pursuit but also a talent I have nurtured since childhood.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to my technical expertise, I have developed a keen interest in the world of finance, particularly in stock market investment. 
  Recognizing the inherent risks and uncertainties in stock investment, 
  I dedicated myself to acquiring extensive knowledge in macro and microeconomics, 
  accounting, and fundamental analysis. This rigorous preparation has enabled me to effectively manage my stock portfolio, 
  which has grown to a value of 21 million IDR by the time I turned 18. 
</p>

<p>
  My journey in stock investment has taught me the critical importance of knowledge in mitigating risk and uncertainty, 
  as well as in seizing future opportunities. This philosophy drives me to continually learn and adapt. 
  Recently, I have ventured into the realm of business, driven by the desire to start my own enterprise. 
  Understanding that business, like stock investment, is fraught with uncertainty and risk, 
  I have studied business model canvas and value proposition canvas to ensure structured and customer-centric business planning.
</p>

<p>
  I firmly believe that customers do not merely care about the products we create but are more concerned with the solutions and benefits these products offer. 
  This customer-oriented approach, 
  combined with my strategic planning skills, sets the foundation for a successful business venture.
</p>

<p>
  In essence, I view the world as a battleground where only the most prepared and knowledgeable individuals can thrive. 
  My dedication to learning, strategic thinking, and self-reliance defines my approach to both personal and professional life. 
  With a solid foundation in technology, finance, and business strategy, 
  I am poised to take on new challenges and create impactful solutions that address real-world problems.
